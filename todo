[+] is_ocean  (only by name)

get_ocean from selection




ocean_data: [{obj: weight.002}]


bugs and test: 

[] is manually changed material chagned when new ocean is added?


changes to Multiple: if only one ocean ==> old behavior (needs name independency) otherwise add selected objects to the active ocean 
[] Float 
[] Static 
[] Remove interaction 

[] remaping to other ocean (check float/static change system), option for float on several objects 

[] UI show selectec when there are more oceans 



[] update material 

[] move foam with attribute: foam textures must move a bit with the waves (aligment). Put driver to get value from alignment
    --> siehe Materialstudie moving foam

presets
[] update and new presets 



GeoNodes Features: 
[] Waves 
[] Waves Break particles 

[++] Spray 
    [] kick to show the particles directly after add without need to change a value 
    [] add experimental tag


[++]nodes to code
# [] nodegroups (rekursivly)
# [] test material node trees
# [] clean up get value section to bl_idname

Loop animation: 
[] of selected ocean

[?] ocean should set there ocean id in there objects
[?] object should save ocean id when floated 
[?] remove single must check for there ocean id when floating 

[] add selection --> active control to 



ui:


fixed bugs:




[] improve presets 


[] changing material should adapt preset setting 

[] remove node setup in make loop before making it

[] ui of special
    [] settings

    [] label when no object in input of mod
    [] label look in the modifiers tab for option
